# linked-list-rs
Study project written in Rust, exploring how to implement a linked list using reference-counted pointers and unit testing.

# Why write a linked list while there's one in std ?
- It is a really good way to understand how safe pointers work in Rust.
- It also was very helpful in finding a proper use case to practice unit testing.
- This is mostly a study project and definitely not code to use in any production-axed codebase.
